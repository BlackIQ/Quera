### What we will do?

Create a function that get a number and tell you differences. Look at sample and Examples.

---

### Sample:

```python
def game(number):
    pass
```

**This function should tell us difference of numbers.**

### Example:

```python
>>> game(17)
6
```

*Now, 7 is bigger than 1. So, 7 - 1 = 6*

```python
>>> game(66)
0
```

*But here both are equal. So, 6 - 6 = 0*

```python
>>> game(81)
7
```

*Again, 8 is bigger than 1. So, 8 - 1 = 7*

### Remember:

- Arg should be two-digit number. Between 10 and 99.
